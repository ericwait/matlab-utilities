<h1>leverUtilities</h1>

leverUtilities is a collection of helper functions used in lever.js (https://leverjs.net)
and other projects. leverUtilities originated in the bioimage lab at Drexel University
(https://bioimage.coe.drexel.edu). The software was developed primarily by Eric Wait and 
Mark Winter, working with Andrew Cohen.

All software in this project is copyright (c) 2015-2017 Drexel University.

This release of leverUtilities is not yet public. It is intended for reviewer evaluation,
and for select external collaborators working with Dr. Cohen's group. For now, the 
software should be considered "unlicensed". Please do not redistribute or share.

The software will be released free and open source concurrent with the publication
of a manuscript describing the work. 

We are still deciding which license to release under. This project does utilize the bioformats code 
(http://www.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/) to convert from microscope file formats to an internal 
lever format. Bioformats is distributed under the GPL, so any derivatives using bioformats must also
be distributed under the GPL. This conversion is not central to lever.js or the leverUtilities project,
so it may be possible to redistribute under a more permissive license. Please contact acohen 'at' coe.drexel.edu
if you have an opinion on this.
